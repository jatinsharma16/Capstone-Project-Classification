# Capstone-Project-Classification
The cardiovascular risk prediction is really important for any patient who might get affected due to this problem, therefore it becomes a major concern to detect the risk before hand so as to provide suitable treatment to the patient and prevent any major problem.

The data that we are provided is from an ongoing study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides with the patients' information. It includes over 3,000 records and 15 attributes. Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioral, and medical risk factors.
